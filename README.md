# HANGMAN
A game of hangman coded in Python3. This game uses the basic format provided in the book "Invent your own computer games with Python", the primary objective here is to expand upon this code, making the game formatted much more nicely, handle different word banks and to optionally give the user more choice and input within the game.

# TODO:
- Format the program, so that:
	- Prompts/messages appear wherever necessary
	- It "looks nice" (\n's included for readability)
	- Squashing basic flow and input bugs
	- Number of guesses left are displayed for len(guess) > 0
- Learn about how to let users make choices in Python3, in order to...
  - Create more word banks and prompt the user to make a choice
  - Allow the user to select a difficulty, which will enable altering:
    - The number of chances the user has to guess
    - The length of the words which are pulled from the word bank
- Learn about implementing sound in Python3, in order to...
	- Play a sound bite when:
		- The program starts
		- The user wins
		- The user loses
	- Play a sound effect when:
		- The user guesses correctly
		- The user guesses incorrectly
	- Create my own sounds for all of the above!!!
